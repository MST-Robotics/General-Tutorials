# General Tutorials

Welcome to the Missouri University of Science and Technology's Underwater Robotics Design Team!

## Getting Started
In order to best asses what work we can give you right away,
please make a quick example program.

### Cloning this Repository
 1. Open a terminal
 2. Move to a folder you'd like to store the repository in
 3. Enter the command `git clone https://github.com/mst-robotics/general-tutorials.git`

### Making a new branch
 1. `cd` into the new repository, `general-tutorials`
 2. run the command `git branch -b your-name`, with `your-name` being your first name

You've now successfuly made your first branch! (At least, on this repo)


### Making your example program
Now you can create your example file!

Run `touch your-name.cpp`, again, with your-name being your first name.
After creating your file, open it with the editor of your choice and create an
example program. The example program should showcase your programming skills,
and should include a tour-de-force of what you know.

If you are unsure what to implement, making a solution to a problem from
[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) or [Open Kattis](http://open.kattis.com)
is an excellent place to start. Remember, you aren't being tested! We're only
trying to see what you already know so we can avoid wasting your time
reteaching you the basics. This way, you can jump right into real work!

Some things to try to exemplify:
 * The way you like to format your code
 * C++ primitives you are familier with
 * Any particular programming paradigms you prefer
 * The degree to which you prefer to document your code through comments
 * Anything that you feel will adequately portray your coding style
